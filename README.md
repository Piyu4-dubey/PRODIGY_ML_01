# PRODIGY_ML_01

📌 Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, number of rooms, etc. The model is trained on a dataset containing real estate prices and provides insights into pricing trends.

🚀 Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Implements Linear Regression with optimized hyperparameters.
Evaluation: Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
Visualization: Plots correlations and regression trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Google Colab for model development

🔧 Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PRODIGY_ML_01.git
cd PRODIGY_ML_01
pip install -r requirements.txt

📂 Usage
Load the dataset (data/house_prices.csv).
Run HousePricePrediction.ipynb to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.
Adjust hyperparameters and visualize results.

📊 Results
Achieves high accuracy in predicting house prices.
Shows significant correlations between features and pricing.
